Installation:

*********
Use:
This theme displays full size images. So be carefull to upload not too large images!
The theme uses the tagsmap module which has been enhanced. If you want to separate geotag from others, name those with the "map." prefix. Hence, they will not be shown in the tag cloud sidebare (the "map." prefix will not be displayed on the map).
